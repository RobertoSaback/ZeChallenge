<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## First Part 

Critical Flows

<br>
  *<strong>Product flow</strong>: This flows refers to the movement of the goods from the supplier to the customer and it would be impossible without a product selection stage to complete the service. The product flow play a key role in moving products through this logistic chain.In fact logistics take the primary onus of an e-commerce entity. Efficiency and service usually reflects this flow as the greatest value for the company since then efficiency  creates a value to the customers , suppliers and stakeholders and it creates visibility into a company.
  <br><br>
  *<strong>Cash flow</strong>: Cash flow: The core idea behind every business is increase profits and value. For this reason a reliable cash flow ensures optimum user experience, consumer safety and fidelity to the future new customers. It ensure that the customer can trust on the company to share sensitive information and the company can trust that all information that comes from the client side are reliable. 
    <br><br>
*<strong>Information Flow</strong>: This flow happens in both the directions and it is necessary for the proper functioning of all the activities in an E-Commerce model. Customers ask for information and likewise the retailer also requires information from the customer. Since, the process is basically online, this flow is important for a smooth transaction and seamless working of the e-commerce.

### Seccond Part

### Setting-Up
For this seccond part I'm assuming that you have an IDE and a pack manager and python installed on your computer. 
With Pip installed you should install selenium modules:<br>
```$ pip install selenium```<br> 
In that way you will install selenium dependencies in your local machine and then you can use your shell to read the files.

This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Leave any add-ons/plugins for the acknowledgements section. Here are a few examples.
* [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com)
* [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
* [Laravel](https://laravel.com)
